# MT5 EA SaaS Platform: Best Practice Implementation Roadmap

## Overview
This document summarizes the key action items and best practices for building a scalable, secure, and robust MT5 EA SaaS platform, based on our AWS architecture and current project state. Each step is prioritized for production-readiness and future growth.

---

## 1. Database Schema Design

- **Action:**
  - Django models for User, MT5Account, MT5TradingSession, AlgorithmExecution, EATemplate, UserEAInstance, and EAPerformance are implemented and migrated.
  - EATemplate, UserEAInstance, and EAPerformance use UUIDs for primary keys, JSONField for configs/stats, and strong foreign key relationships.
  - UserEAInstance enforces unique (user, ea_template, mt5_account) constraint to prevent duplicates.
  - Indexes added to frequently queried fields for performance (user, ea_template, mt5_account, name, user_ea_instance).
  - All models have created_at/updated_at for auditability.
  - Sensitive credentials (MT5 passwords) are stored encrypted, with future AWS KMS integration planned.

- **Best Practices:**
  - Use UUIDs for all primary keys for security and scalability.
  - Store sensitive MT5 credentials encrypted (AWS KMS or strong encryption library).
  - Use JSONField for flexible EA configs, tier access, and stats.
  - Enforce foreign key relationships and unique constraints for data integrity.
  - Add database indexes to optimize query performance.
  - Use null=False and blank=False for required fields.
  - Never log or expose sensitive fields in admin or API.

- **Reason:**
  - A robust, indexed, and secure schema is the foundation for access control, multi-tenancy, analytics, and production scalability.

---

## 2. Secure Credential Management
- **Action:** Integrate AWS KMS for encrypting/decrypting MT5 credentials in the backend.
- **Best Practices:**
  - Never store plaintext credentials.
  - Use environment variables for KMS keys and secrets.
- **Reason:** Protects user data and meets compliance requirements.

---

## 3. Dockerization & Container Orchestration
- **Action:**
  - Dockerize Django API, React frontend, and EA runner scripts.
  - Use ECS for web/API, EC2 for Windows/MT5 EAs.
- **Best Practices:**
  - Use multi-stage builds for smaller images.
  - Pin dependency versions for reproducibility.
  - Use health checks and resource limits in Docker/ECS configs.
- **Reason:** Enables scalable, isolated deployments and easy CI/CD.

---

## 4. Task Queue & EA Orchestration
- **Action:** Set up Celery with Redis/ElastiCache for async EA deployment, pausing, and monitoring.
- **Best Practices:**
  - Use idempotent Celery tasks for reliability.
  - Store task results/status in the database for auditability.
- **Reason:** Decouples user actions from long-running EA operations, improving UX and reliability.

---

## 5. Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
- **Action:** Use Terraform to provision VPC, ECS, EC2, RDS, ElastiCache, and security groups.
- **Best Practices:**
  - Modularize Terraform code for reusability.
  - Use remote state (e.g., S3 + DynamoDB) for team safety.
- **Reason:** Ensures repeatable, auditable, and version-controlled infrastructure changes.

---

## 6. CI/CD Pipeline
- **Action:** Implement GitHub Actions for build, test, and deploy of all services to AWS (ECR/ECS).
- **Best Practices:**
  - Use separate jobs for linting, testing, and deployment.
  - Store secrets in GitHub Actions secrets, not in code.
- **Reason:** Automates deployments, reduces human error, and speeds up iteration.

---

## 7. Monitoring & Cost Optimization
- **Action:**
  - Set up CloudWatch dashboards and alarms for EAs, infra, and costs.
  - Use reserved/spot instances and auto-scaling for cost control.
- **Best Practices:**
  - Alert on high loss, high CPU, and DB connection saturation.
  - Regularly review AWS bills and optimize instance types.
- **Reason:** Ensures reliability, fast incident response, and sustainable costs.

---

## 8. Security & Compliance
- **Action:**
  - Harden VPC, subnets, and security groups.
  - Implement audit logging and regular backups.
  - Set up WAF and penetration testing before launch.
- **Best Practices:**
  - Principle of least privilege for IAM roles.
  - Encrypt all data in transit and at rest.
- **Reason:** Protects user data, meets regulatory requirements, and builds trust.

---

## 9. Phased Rollout Plan
- **Phase 1:** Core infra, DB, API, frontend, and basic EA deployment
- **Phase 2:** EA orchestration, scaling, and user limits
- **Phase 3:** AI/market analysis, advanced monitoring, and cost optimization
- **Phase 4:** Security hardening, compliance, and performance testing
