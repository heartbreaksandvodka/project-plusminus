Professional MetaTrader 5 Expert Advisors Collection
Author: Johannes N. Nkosi
Date: July 25, 2025

This is the main algorithms development workspace with a centralized Python environment for developing and running sophisticated trading strategies.

## Python Environment

- **Python Version**: 3.13.3
- **Installed Packages**:
  - MetaTrader5 (5.0.5120)
  - pandas (2.3.1)
  - numpy (2.3.2)
  - All other required dependencies

## Expert Advisors Collection

Each Expert Advisor (EA) has its own dedicated folder containing:
- Main EA script with complete strategy implementation
- Configuration files for easy customization
- Comprehensive test scripts for validation
- Interactive launcher scripts for user-friendly operation
- Detailed documentation and usage guides
- Windows batch files for quick startup

### Code Reuse & Shared Utilities

All EA scripts now use shared utility functions from `common_ea.py` for:
- MetaTrader 5 initialization and login
- Symbol information and price retrieval
- Pause/resume logic via file-based flags (Windows compatible)

This ensures consistent, maintainable, and robust code across all EAs. To use these utilities, simply import from:

```python
from ALGORITHMSMT5EA.common_ea import initialize_mt5, get_symbol_info, get_current_price, check_pause_flag
```

Refer to `common_ea.py` for details and usage examples.
